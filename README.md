# Efficient-way-of-Printing-Diamond-in-Java

At a Begginer level lot of people practice printing diamond to console. It is very likely that they will be very in efficient in terms of time complexity like quadratic(n^2), or nlogn etc.

Here I would like to present best time complexity algorithm that i could come with to solve this problem, which is Linear (Order of n).
I also would like to mention that interms of space complexity i used extra 4 bytes memory [2 integer variables] compared usual one's. But, when we have big number this approach is going to be really good performance jump.
