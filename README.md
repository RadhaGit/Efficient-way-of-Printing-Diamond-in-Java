# Efficient-way-of-Printing-Diamond-in-Java

At a Begginer level lot of people practice printing diamond to console. It is very likely that we will approach very in-efficient algorithms in terms of time complexity like quadratic(n^2), or nlogn etc.

Here I would like to present best time complexity algorithm that i could come with to solve this problem, which is Linear (Order of n).
I also would like to mention that interms of space complexity i used extra 4 bytes memory [2 integer variables] compared usual one's. But, when we have big number this approach is going to be really good performance jump.

In this program there are two loops each run n times.So, order of growth interms of "n" would be 2n.
There fore, Order of growth is Linear.

******Though the program looks like 45 lines of code, it is due to excessive comments. It is very small program*********
